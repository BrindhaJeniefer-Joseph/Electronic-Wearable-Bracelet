# Electronic Wearable Bracelet with Textile sensor

The goal of this project is to design a wearable electronic bracelet which can be used as an emergency situation notifier. The objective is to build a pressure sensor, from the textile, which will be used to inform the emergency messages. Since the person who is wearing the bracelet has to press the sensor, there is no automatic mode involved in the design. Manual mode involves pressing the pressure sensor attached in the bracelet. Neoprene textile pressure sensitive pad in the bracelet will be useful for elderly people or physically challenged people or people who need otherâ€™s help in emergency situations. Depends on the pressure level sensed by the textile neoprene pushbutton, different types of information can be shared.
